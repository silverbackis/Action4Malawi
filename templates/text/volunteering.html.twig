<p>Action4Malawi was launched in 2017 as a result of the long term friendship between a leading community organiser in Malawi and a documentary filmmaker in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>We believe that A4Mâ€™s volunteers will share the common understanding that when we volunteer, it is a merit. Volunteering is a gift shared rather than a gift given.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Why is this so important?</h4>
<p>When we share our time we overcome our own selfish desires, we extricate ourselves from our bound-up lives and we connect on a deeper level to the world around us; we constantly experience new opportunities to overcome and grow. As such, A4M volunteers deepen care and consideration for the world far beyond their own specific experience.</p>
